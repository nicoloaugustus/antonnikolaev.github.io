I am an economist working at the intersection of **health economics**, **applied microeconomics**, and **spatial/panel-data econometrics**.  
Currently Master in Economic Policy (MSU). I build empirical models (fixed effects, spatial SAR, elastic-net, PCA-based indices) to study regional health and labor outcomes, and I design decision-support tools that translate research into policy-relevant insights.

**Research interests:** Applied Micro, Health Economics, Demography; Panel & Spatial Econometrics.
