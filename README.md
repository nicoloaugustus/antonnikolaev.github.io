# Anton Nikolaev — Academic Website

This repository is a ready-to-publish personal academic site for **Anton Nikolaev** on GitHub Pages.

## Quick start

1. Create a new repository named `antonnikolaev.github.io` (or any repo name you prefer).
2. Upload (or drag & drop) all files from this zip into your repo root.
3. Go to **Settings → Pages** and select the **main** branch as the source (if not already enabled).
4. Your site will appear at `https://<your-username>.github.io/` (or at your custom domain, if configured).

### Editing content

- Update `_config.yml` with your links (Google Scholar, ORCID, etc.).
- Pages live in `_pages/` as Markdown files.
- Publications are in `_pages/publications.md` — just edit the Markdown list.
- Your CV PDF is in `assets/cv/AntonNikolaevCV.pdf` and is linked from the **CV** page.

If you later want the full **academicpages** Jekyll theme, you can keep this structure and add `remote_theme` as shown in `_config.yml`.
