I am an economist working at the intersection of **health economics**, **applied microeconomics**, and **spatial/panel-data econometrics**.  
Currently Master in Economic Policy (MSU) and Senior Analyst at a health‑economics department. I build empirical models (fixed effects, spatial SAR, LASSO, PCA-driven indices) to study regional health and labor outcomes, and I design decision‑support tools that translate research into policy‑relevant insights.

**Research interests:** Applied Micro, Labor, Demography; Panel‑Data Econometrics, Spatial Econometrics.
